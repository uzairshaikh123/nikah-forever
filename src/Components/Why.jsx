<p style={{padding:"10px",fontSize:"14px"}}>In Islam we believe nikah to be a blessing bestowed upon us by Allah (SWT). It has been mentioned several times in the Qur’an and holds utmost importance, and acts as a barrier between halal and haram. It has been said that when a person gets married, he completes half of his deen. We, at Nikah Forever, understand the importance of choosing the right one, to be with you in this life and the hereafter, and who would complete half of your deen.</p>
